        <h1>About Me</h1>

        <p>
          I’m Arav Grover a computer science student who likes building real things more than talking about them. 
          Curiosity is what drives me. I enjoy taking a problem apart understanding what matters and then shaping something 
          that works. That’s been the pattern behind most of what I do whether it’s an iOS AI chatbot with that stores memory
          and communicate with ease or web platforms that make everyday tasks a little smarter.
        </p>

        <p>
          I gravitate toward projects where I feel I can make something that will change the way of living. When I built the 
          SwiftUI chatbot the fun wasn’t just the model calls it was stitching together context, memory and the UI. 
          With NutriWise it was about creating a platform which provided AI insights so it could actually help someone 
          make a better choice. And with waste management work it was the challenge of turning recognition and data flows 
          into something a campus could track and act on and at the same time benefit the people in need.
        </p>

        <p>
          Internships helped me sharpen that mindset. At PwC I learned how to translate massive ollections of F1 data into 
          clean structures ontologies, star schemas, and a multi decade dataset that lets people ask better questions and 
          understand the data in a simple and sort of fun way. At Capgemini I worked inside 5G systems implementing emergency 
          session support in the SMF with Go and validating the behavior across nodes. 
          Different domains, same lesson: simplify, prove it and then scale.
        </p>

        <p>
          I’m happiest when I’m in the loop of building, testing and refining. I like straightforward tools, clear trade offs, 
          and code that doesn’t fight you but rather helps you. I care about performance and usability because they’re what 
          people actually feel. I care about collaboration because good ideas get better when you stress test them with other builders.
        </p>

        <p>
          Leadership in my eyes isn’t about titles but about learning how to bring people together and move things forward. 
          Through the National Society of Leadership & Success I’ve been pushed to reflect on my own habits and values while 
          practicing skills like active listening, accountability, and goal setting. The program taught me that leadership is 
          iterative you try, you miss, you adjust, and you grow. What excites me most is that leadership feels less like a 
          finish line and more like a craft that I’ll be working on for the rest of my life.
        </p>

        <p>
          Outside the coding enviornment I’m still the same person curious, competitive in a healthy way, and always learning. I like 
          fast feedback, clear goals, and working on things that matter more than they appear on paper. My plan is simple: keep 
          making effort to build useful software, keep stretching what I can build, and keep working with teams that would 
          never give up.
