      <p>
        I’m Arav Grover a computer science student who likes building real things more than
        talking about them. Curiosity is what drives me. I enjoy taking a problem apart
        understanding what actually matters and then shaping something that works. That’s been
        the pattern behind most of what I do whether it’s an iOS AI chatbot with that stores 
        memory and communicate with ease or web platforms that make everyday tasks a little
        smarter.
      </p>
      <p>
        I gravitate toward projects where I feel I can make something that will change the way of living. 
        When I built the SwiftUI chatbot the fun wasn’t just the model calls it was stitching
        together context, memory and the UI.
        With NutriWise it was about creating a platform which provided AI insights so it could 
        actually help someone make a better choice.
        And with waste management work it was the challenge of turning recognition and data flows
        into something a campus could track and act on and at the same time benefit the people in need.
      </p>
      <p>
        Internships helped me sharpen that mindset. At PwC I learned how to translate massive ollections
        of F1 data into clean structures ontologies, star schemas, and a multi decade dataset that lets
        people ask better questions and understand the data in a simple and sort of fun way. 
        At Capgemini I worked inside 5G systems implementing emergency session support in the SMF with Go
        and validating the behavior across nodes. 
        Different domains, same lesson: simplify, prove it and then scale.
      </p>
      <p>
        I’m happiest when I’m in the loop of building, testing and refining. I like straightforward
        tools, clear trade offs, and code that doesn’t fight you but rather helps you. I care about 
        performance and usability because they’re what people actually feel. I care about 
        collaboration because good ideas get better when you stress test them with other builders.
      </p>
      <p>
        Leadership in my eyes isn’t about titles but about learning how to bring people together and 
        move things forward. Through the National Society of Leadership & Success I’ve been pushed 
        to reflect on my own habits and values while practicing skills like active listening, 
        accountability, and goal setting. The program taught me that leadership is iterative 
        you try, you miss, you adjust, and you grow. What excites me most is that 
        leadership feels less like a finish line and more like a craft that I’ll be working on 
        for the rest of my life.
      </p>
      <p>
        Outside the editor I’m still the same person curious, competitive in a healthy way, and
        always learning. I like fast feedback, clear goals, and working on things that matter more
        than they appear on paper. My plan is simple: keep making effort to build useful software,
        keep stretching what I can build, and keep working with teams that would never give up.
      </p>
